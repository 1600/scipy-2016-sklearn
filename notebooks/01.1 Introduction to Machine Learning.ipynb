      "Machine learning is a process to automatically extract knowledge from data, usually with the goal of making predictions on new, unseen data. A classical example is a spam filter, for which the user keeps labeling incoming mails as either spam or not spam. A machine learning algorithm then \"learns\" what distinguishes spam from normal emails, and can predict for new emails whether they are spam or not.\n",
