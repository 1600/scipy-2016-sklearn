    "Machine learning is the process to automatically extract knowledge from data, usually with the goal of making predictions on new, unseen data. A classical example is a spam filter, for which the user keeps labeling incoming mails as either spam or not spam. A machine learning algorithm then \"learns\" what distinguishes spam from normal emails, and can predict for new emails whether they are spam or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Central to machine learning is the concept of **making decision automatically** from data, **without the user specifying explicit rules** how this decision should be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the case of emails, the user doesn't provide a list of words or characteristics that make an email spam. Instead, the user provides examples of spam and non-spam emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second central concept is **generalization**. The goal of a machine learning algorithm is to predict on new, previously unseen data. We are not interested in marking an email as spam or not, that the human already labeled. Instead, we want to make the users life easier by making an automatic decision for new incoming mail."
