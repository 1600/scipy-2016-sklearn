Supervised / unsupervised diagrams at the beginning
add preprocessing / real world example with titanic
estimator summary (when to use what, runtime complexity etc)
user learning_curve and validation_curve functions in 06.1
add calibration notebook
connect 4.03 (validation) and 6.01 (cross-validation and model selection)
something on single machine parallelization? n_jobs?
model persistence

maybe use adult dataset? That looks cool for preprocessing!!!

features selection?

randomized search?
