Supervised / unsupervised diagrams at the beginning
more diagrams everywhere?
Move supervised / unsupervised explanation more to the front
add explanation of fit / predict api!
add preprocessing / real world example with titanic
estimator summary (when to use what, runtime complexity etc)
user learning_curve and validation_curve functions in 06.1
add roc curve to classifier evaluation, discuss asymmetic loss and imbalanced datasets.
add calibration notebook
connect 4.03 (validation) and 6.01 (cross-validation and model selection)
more elaborate intro of cross-validation and grid-searching
something on single machine parallelization? n_jobs?
model persistence
